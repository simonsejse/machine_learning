# Before deciding, it’s helpful to take a quick look at your data distribution. Even though it’s subjective, you can still visualize the distribution to get an idea of its shape. You can use a histogram or summary statistics to understand whether your data is skewed or if there are any outliers.

#movies_data['metacritic_cleaned'].hist(bins=20)
#print(movies_data['metacritic_cleaned'].describe())
